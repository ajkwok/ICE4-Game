# ICE4-Game
Create a game with low(1-5)/medium(6-10)/high(11-15) level dungeons.
User starts at level 1 and gives a list of low level dungeons to complete. Each dungeon grants 1 level upon completion,
but has a 10% chance to fail.

Fail Rate:     
  low level: 10% chance     
  medium level: 25% chance     
  high level: 50% chance     

If they fail, game over.  List achievements(level, # completed dungeons, etc.)
